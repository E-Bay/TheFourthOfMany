<h1>The Beauties of the Zen Garden</h1>
<p class="one"><a class="one" href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">Zen Garden</a> is an interactive website designed to help not only students, but anyone interested in programming and web design. It is also a simple website made to show off everything the code can do. From simple tasks as changing the font of the words they type, to rearranging everything on the webpage, they are able to show complete mastery over the coding. They make it easy for people who have never coded before and allow those who have been coding for a long time show off their skills.</p>
<p class="two">One of the submited designs that they show off is the <a class="two" href="http://www.csszengarden.com/219/">Steel</a> it shows off a bunch of unique techniques we have not been shown yet such as moving words across the screen to interactivity with certain areas. I cannot find how this is done in the code unless I am missing something important. But their are some things in their that we learned in the reading.</p>
<p class="three">One thing we learned in our reading was the use of "margin" and "overflow" commands. Margin was what made the cool outside layers around the text boxes we see. While overflow has the most important command in all of web design pretty much, allowing us to scroll through when needed. These were some of the main contributors to the amazing Steel design for the <a class="three" href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">Zen Garden</a> website.</p>
